This repository contains the code for the experiments performed during the thesis research. Training and heavy computations are done using the GPUs from Compute Canada. To replicate the works done in this research, I have uploaded either the juypter notebook or the scripts being used in compute canada. The scripts tell you which python file to start with in understanding the workflow.

The datasets used are: MNIST, FashionMNIST, CelebA, LSUN, google stock, energy, CIFAR-10, SVHN, and a custom dataset.

The custom dataset can be found in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_YAlJPPy9xtLiNvzihgCfo8aImWMCq6I/view?usp=sharing
The rest of the dataset can be downloaded using pytorch.
